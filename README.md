# soap-ws

## A lightweight and easy-to-use Java library to handle SOAP on a purely XML level.

### Intro
Welcome to soap-ws! This is a lightweight and easy-to-use Java library to handle SOAP message generation and SOAP message transmission on a purely XML level. With the usage of this library
within few lines of code you can easily import your WSDL and generate SOAP messages directly in an XML format. 
Then you can use the SoapClient to transmit this message over HTTP(s) to a web-service endpoint. 
Finally, you can run SoapServer to receive SOAP messages and and respond to them. 
And all of that requires no classes or stubs generation - everything happens directly in an XML format.


### Why should you use soap-ws?
Read this carefully and check if you know what we are talking about.

* Have you ever had problems with the versioning of web-service endpoints? Have you ever had to address the problem how to deal with many versions of the same classes generated from two versions of the same WSDL in one code base? Did you try to prefix the classes, change the package, or do any other mambo-jumbo tricks that are clearly against the best-practices of software design?
* Have you every tried to chain and orchestrate a few web-service invocations applying some XSLT transformation to the consecutive responses forwarding them to the next endpoint? Have you ever seen how cumbersome it is using Java generated ws clients/servers?
* Have you ever had to re-generate the ws-stubs, recompile and redeploy you application because of a tiny change in the WSDL?
* Have you every been confused why you generate all these domain and stub classes to invoke one simple web-service operation and to get a plain response that could be processed with XSTL one-liner?
* Have you ever had to had to send a simple XML message to a SOAP server in a fire and forget mode?
* Have you ever had to expose a mock SOAP endpoint that would respond to the request sending a sample response -let's say in an unit test?
* Have you ever had to download a hierarchical WSDL file with hierarchical XSD schemas and store it on your local hard drive with all the import and includes fixed properly so that you can reuse it locally?
* Have you everâ€¦

Yes, that's what soap-ws can do for you. But it can do much more, just dive in and check the plethora of stuff that we have implemented.

## User Guide

### Quick-start

#### Add soap-ws to your maven project
In order to use soap-ws in your project you have to declare soap-ws in the dependencies section of your pom.xml. You can add soap-builder, soap-client, soap-server or all of them, depending on the fact which components you want to use.
```xml
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
    	<groupId>com.centeractive</groupId>
        <artifactId>soap-builder</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.centeractive</groupId>
        <artifactId>soap-client</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.centeractive</groupId>
        <artifactId>soap-server</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
soap-ws is not yet located in the central maven repo, thus you also have to add an additional repository to your config.
```xml
<repositories>
	<repository>
    	<id>centeractive</id>
        <url>TODO</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

#### soap-builder
The usage of SoapBuilder is a bit complex. It is a consequence of two facts: its code, that was inherited from a 3rd party project (see Note), is relatively complex. The second fact is just the complexity of a WSDL itself. There is a significant amount of work already planned to reimplement SoapBuilder, but for now, it's not that bad either.

SoapBuilder object is responsible for the generation of the XML SOAP messages. The simplest way of initializing the SoapBuilder object is to invoke the constructor specifying the URL of the WSDL file. 
```java
SoapBuilder builder = new SoapBuilder(wsdlUrl); 
```
Soap builder reads the specified WSDL file recursively,) fetching all included WSDL and XSD files, and constructs an underlying Definition object that is the Java-based representation of the WSDL (see WSDL4j to read more about the Definitoin). You can get the underlying definition object by invoking the build.getDefinition() method.
```java
builder.getDefinition()
```
In order to generate a SOAP message you have to specify the Binding and the BindingOperation (coming directly from the Definition object). 
To check what binding and operation are defined in the WSDL invoke the following methods (see WSDL4J doc for more details on Definition, Binding and BindingOperation):
```java
builder.getDefinition().getAllBindings();
binding.getBindingOperations();
```

When you decide which binding and BindingOperation you want to use just invoke the static SoapBuilder.getOperation() to build the wrapper object that can be easily consumed by the generation engine:
```java
OperationWrapper operationWrapper = builder.getOperation(binding, bindingOperation);
```
Now you are good to go. To generate SOAP message in the XML format just invoke one of the methods whose names begins with build* prefix (they are often overloaded) passing the OperationWrapper object that specifies the target operation.
```java
String envelopeInput = builder.buildSoapMessageFromInput(operationWrapper);
String envelopeOutput = builder.buildSoapMessageFromOutput(operationWrapper);
```

You can also build generic empty messages invoking buildEmptyMessage or buildFault.

Last, but not least. In most of the cases, you can relay on the default settings of the context the specifies how messages are generate, but if you would like to change it you have to populate the SoapContext object and pass it either to the constructor (from that moment on, SoapBuilder will use this context as the default one), or to single methods, changing the context of the generation for time span of single method invocation. You can also overwrite the default context by invoking the setContext() method. In order to populate a SoapContext object use the fluent builder. 
```java
SoapContext context = SoapContext.builder()
	.alwaysBuildHeaders(true)
    .buildOptional(true)
    .exampleContent(true)            
    .typeComment(true)
    .skipComments(false)
    .build(); 
```

OK, now the easy part begins...

#### soap-client
You can create an instance of a soap-client using a fluent builder. If you want to use a plain HTTP connection without tweaking any advance options you are good to go with the following snippet:
```java
SoapClient client = SoapClient.builder()
	.endpointUrl("http://example.com/endpoint")
	.build();
```
Then, you can send a SOAP envelope (as a String) invoking the post() method:
```java
client.post(soapAction, envelope);
```

You can also skip the SOAPAction header and send the envelope only:
```java
client.post(envelope);
```
Isn't it easy? But it's gonna be even better :)

#### soap-server
Use a similar builder to create an instance of the soap-server. 
```java
SoapServer server = SoapServer.builder()
                .httpPort(8080)
                .build();
```
You can start and stop the server using start/stop methods
```java
server.start();
server.stop();
```

Now we would like to turn our server into a mock server that responds to request generating a sample content that is complaint with the schema of the operation that is being invoked.
To do that we have to create an AutoResponder and register it under the given context path.
Autoresponder requires a SoapBuilder (that contains the WSDL) and the binding name which it should use. Keep in mind the there can be only one binding under one context path;
```java
String contextPath = "exampleEndpoint";
AutoResponder responder = new AutoResponder(soapBuilder, bindingName);
server.registerResponder(contextPath, responder);
```
From that moment our server will respond to request send to the "exampleEndpoint" context path.

If you would like to handle the request yourself you just have to implement the RequestResponder interface. 
```java
public interface RequestResponder {
 	java.xml.Source respond(SoapMessage request);
}
```

It may be a bit cumbersome, as it is not that easy to match an XML request to the binding and operation, that is the reason why we provided an AbstractResponder that does all of that backstage.
```java
public abstract class AbstractResponder implements RequestResponder {
 	/**
     * Abstract method that should be implemented by overriding classes.
     * This method is invoked whenever a request is send by the client.
     * InvokedOperation may be passed to a SoapBuilder to construct the
     * response to the request that was sent by the client.
     *
     * @param invokedOperation operation from the binding that is matched to the SOAP message
     * @param message          SOAP message passed by the client
     * @return response in the XML source format containing the whole SOAP envelope
     */
    public abstract Source respond(OperationWrapper invokedOperation, SoapMessage message);
}
```

AbstractResponder does all the hard work for you to match the message to the BindingOperation from the WSDL. If it find it the respond() operation is invoked, if not a SOAP fault is send back to the client saying the operation has not been found.
AbstractResponder uses our implementation of the SoapOperationMatcher that matches the request to the operation in the following way:  

* SOAP Action mapping
* RCP bindings are matched using single top-level tag with the name of the invoked operation
* Document bindings are matched by input types and then by input names
 
Having the OperationWrapper object provided by the AbstractResponder you can easily generate and modify the response that you generate using SoapBuilder that available in the responder as a builder class field.

That's a lot of stuff! Try it out now and leave send us some feedback!

### Note
This project contains classes extracted from the soapUI code base by centeractive ag
in October 2011. They are located in the soap-builder module. Every extracted class is
annotated with an comment to fulfill he requirements of the LGPL 2.1 license under
which soapUI is released. That is also the reason why soap-builder module is also
released under LGPL 2.1 license. All other soap-ws modules are released under Apache
v.2 license. The main reason behind class the extraction was to separate the code that
is responsible for the generation of the SOAP messages from the rest of the soapUI's
code that is tightly coupled with other modules, such as soapUI's graphical user
interface, etc. The goal was to create an open-source java project whose main
responsibility is to handle SOAP message generation and SOAP transmission purely on
an XML level.

centeractive ag would like to express strong appreciation to SmartBear Software and
to the whole team of soapUI's developers for creating soapUI and for releasing its
source code under a free and open-source license. centeractive ag extracted and
modifies some parts of the soapUI's code in good faith, making every effort not
to impair any existing functionality and to supplement it according to our
requirements, applying best practices of software design.
